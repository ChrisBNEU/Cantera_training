    "# Installing Cantera\n",
    "For this notebook you will need [Cantera](http://www.cantera.org/), an open source suite of object-oriented software tools for problems involving chemical kinetics, thermodynamics, and/or transport processes.\n",
    "Fortunately there are now Anaconda packages (in the `cantera` channel), so to install you can simply type \n",
    "```\n",
    "conda install -c cantera cantera\n",
    "```\n",
    "at your terminal (if you can remember back to when you installed Anaconda!).\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are on Windows *and* you get an error like `ImportError: DLL load failed: The specified module could not be found.` then you probably also need to install the Visual C++ Redistributable which you can get [from Microsoft here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48145).  If you don't have this problem, let me know and I can updated these instructions!\n",
    "\n",
    "There are other, more difficult, ways to install it in [the instructions](http://www.cantera.org/docs/sphinx/html/install.html) if you can't get the Anaconda packages to work. It is also already on the COE computer lab 274 Snell (though there you will have to `pip install jupyter` to get this notebook working)."
